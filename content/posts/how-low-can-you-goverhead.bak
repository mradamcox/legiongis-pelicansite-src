Please excuse, for now and forever, the cleverness of my article titles. This post is about how we are setting up our business with as little overhead as possible.

While cheap may not be too hard to accomplish, cheap, smart, and long-lasting is much more difficult. So I knew there would be a bit of up front work that would pay off later. I love infrastructure, so the challenge to create a solid, long-lasting internal system was a fun challenge. Here's what it looks like:

First, I bought legiongis.com on GoDaddy last October, immediately after thinking of the name while staring out a passenger car window. It was a perfect combination of this, this, and this. GoDaddy had a special going on (like always it seems) so I bought two years for a total of $10.34. Got lucky with that one.

Fast-forward a few months to late January (which skips over the whole [LLC creation] (a couple hours and $130), acquisition of a federal EIN (1/2 hour?), a couple of accountant meetings and lots of work with Brendan on the Operating Agreement... maybe a post about that at some point?), where the next task was email addresses. Google used to give you @yourdomainname.com email addresses for free (or so I've read), but now we were looking at Google Apps for Business, which is $5/month/user. Not satisfied with that. Which led me to Zoho, a free (up to 5 users) email hosting service. Mail forwarding was very important too, so we wouldn't ever actually have to look at a different inbox. Assured by numerous tutorials that this was easy, I signed up for Zoho, set things up, and crossed email off the list, zero dollars.

It seems obvious that we would want to keep our monthly bills as low (who wouldn't?), but I also knew that to do so would require 




 but as a tech-based consulting firm we have some requirements to meet. First though, here are the things we don't have to worry about, some of which were intentionally created for just that reason:

*We don't need much space
*We don't 

After many hours of wrangling, configuring, contemplating, reconfiguring, and retemplating (!) we are ready to launch our website. You could call it a pre-branding, as the format and lack of logo could stand some attention, but overall we're pretty happy with it. In the future we'll also write about how we're generating and hosting this site, but first things first: **Thank you for checking out our new business!**

Legion GIS, LLC is a small member-managed partnership adventure. If you look at our [services](pages/services.html) page, you'll see that collaboration and knowledge-sharing are integral to our mission, and we mean that on many levels. In the future you can look forward to blog posts not only about maps, web development, and spatial data, but also accounting, history, and maybe even taxes if we're in the mood. Definitely some actual _fun_ stuff too.

We'd like to think of this as the beginning of Phase 1. Through collaboration with the wonderful [Valley Stewardship Network](http://www.kickapoovsn.org/), we've been granted the opportunity to embed our office within a new endeavor of their own: a citizen-oriented GIS resource center located in downtown Viroqua, Wisconsin. Our presence in the new space on Main St. will help the VSN get their vision off the ground, and will give us the best environment possible to test our instructive and facilitative capacity. Much more about that to come.

Phase 2 is will begin at the end of the summer, when we expect to find ourselves hurtling toward a multitude of new Opportunities and Explorations. More on that to come as well.

After working as independent contractors, we are both very excited to be a _real_ business.  We even have a checkbook, and have plans to buy an embosser with our logo on it, once we have a logo.

So, before you leave, be sure to learn a little about the services we offer, which is where you can also take a look at some of our team's past work. And, most of all, please [get in touch](pages/contact.html) with us! We are always happy to get your feedback, questions, and random thoughts.

Hope to see you coming back,
