We are excited to have the opportunity to teach GIS introduction classes through a partnership with the Valley Stewardship Network.  Along with lectures on general GIS principals and concepts, we plan to focus on teaching Quantum GIS, a free and open source software that anyone can use. Classes will be held in March and July of 2016, so stay tuned for more information.

We also see our blog as a great way to "give back" in an educational sense. We plan for it to serve as a repository of guides, commentaries, and tips for all sorts of GIS applications.
