Title: CSP Volunteer Efforts
save_as: csp-volunteer-efforts.html

As part of the Karst Landscapes and Groundwater Susceptibility: A Survey of Crawford County, WI, a study undertaken by the Crawford Stewardship Project with funding from the Save The Hills Alliance, Legion GIS helped to facilitate three volunteer efforts to use citizen engagement to improve a few GIS datasets. These events took the form of three two-hour workshops, open to the public and housed in various locations in Vernon and Crawford Counties.

We tackled a different task during each event, with varying degrees of success. Below we will link to a few blog posts about these events, with more coming as we finish work on the study itself.
