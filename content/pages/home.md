&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legion GIS, LLC is a small consulting firm specializing in Geographic Information Systems.  We have experience in a wide variety of applications, from cultural heritage to conservation science to hazard mitigation.  We see GIS as an exciting way to view and explore the world, but one that is largely unknown to everyday folks.  We want to change that!  For more information on what we can do for your organization, please check out our services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also very excited to have a blog, and plan to fill it up with all kinds of interesting information... from technical guides to commentary to details about how we started this business.  Truly, we hope to share everything we can.
