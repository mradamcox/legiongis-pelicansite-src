<center><h3>About Us</h3></center>

Legion GIS, LLC is a small consulting firm specializing in Geographic Information Systems. We have experience with a wide variety of spatial applications, from historic preservation to conservation science and from brochures to spatial databases. We see GIS as an exciting way to view and explore the world, but one that is largely unknown to everyday folks. We want to change that! For more information on what we can do for your organization, please check out our [services](/pages/services.html). Also, take a look at our [blog](/pages/blog.html), where we get to publish our inspirations and aspirations.
