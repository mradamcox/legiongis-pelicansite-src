<center><h3>Philosophy</h3></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer services, not products. With this philosophy we are able to share as much information with our clients and community as possible without undercutting our own livelihood. As largely self-taught individuals, we see collaboration not as a compromise but as a survival mechanism, one that has been benefited us greatly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We try hard to offer all of our services at reasonable and transparent prices, because we hope to be a viable option for organizations with low budgets. That's why we've worked hard to set up our business up with very low overhead; we have no desire to pass those costs on to you. All of that gets in the way of getting GIS into your hands, which is what we're all about.
